# Smooth VSCode settings
The default settings have a wide compatibility, but can be a little bit conservative. These settings are progressive enhancements making VSCode generally more *smooth*.

You can view `.vscode/settings.json` since there are comments (allowed in VSCode JSON).

Open this project in VSCode to try out these settings (VSCode will apply them for this project locally).

The settings are mainly used in web development context, but also apply in shell scripts of configs.
